# Hi, I'm Kaushik!. 

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a passionate and curious second-year Computer Science student from Bhubaneswar, currently on an exciting journey to become a Full-Stack Developer.

I love the process of turning an idea into a real, tangible product that can make someone's day a little better. When I'm not coding, you can probably find me exploring new cafes or reading a good sci fi book.
